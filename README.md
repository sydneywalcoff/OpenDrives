# Test Engineer Test: 'TODO MVP'

Welcome to the test engineer code test! This will be a test of your:
1. Ability to troubleshoot
2. Organizational capabilities

The point of this test is to understand how you approach a technical problem. The way you approach these problems are just as important as your solutions. 

*Please communicate with us via email as if you already work here, and add documentation/comments as you go along.*

We expect this test to take you about 4 - 8 hours. Given that most people are busy, we'd like to hear back from you within 72 hours of starting.

Send us an email when you're finished and we'll schedule a code review with engineers from across our teams to discuss your submission. We'll discuss the finer
 points of your implementation, walk through your code, demo its functionality (or troubleshoot its brokenness), and give feedback on its strengths, weaknesses 
 and, if we're being honest with ourselves, bugs. We don't expect your submission to be perfect, but we do expect you to be able to frankly communicate and 
 discuss your submission in a professional environment.

## Overall Requirements

Your task is to take charge of the Quality Assurance for the attached web application. It is a simple TODO application in which a user can Add and Remove todos, as well as mark todo's as Done or Undone.

It is your task to create a QA testing approach to ensure the quality of this product. This is a twofold process.

1. Create a manual testing script using whatever tools you prefer, and validate the todo app against it.
2. Create an automated testing mechanism using whatever tools you prefer.
3. Create a report of your testing against this todo app to present to our team

#### As soon as you begin:
* [ ] Fork this repository into a public repository on your gitlab/etc account

#### While working on this, please:
* [ ] Commit early and often. We'll likely be following along with your progress.

#### Upon completing this, please post to us:
* [ ] A link to somewhere we may view your QA Checklist
* [ ] A link to your git repository such that we may view your automated QA code
* [ ] A link to somewhere we may view your QA Report of our product

## Testing Requirements

#### Manual Testing
* [ ] Test all interaction cases that you deem worthy

#### Automated Testing
* [ ] Test major interactions listed
  * [ ] Create TODO
  * [ ] Complete TODO
  * [ ] Un-Complete TODO
  * [ ] Destroy TODO

#### Final Report
